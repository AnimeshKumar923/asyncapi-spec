so the plan is we have examples in a big spec document which is in markdown and has embedded examples in it. Then we manually add comments on the examples that we want to validate. The document in which the comment will be added is in the markdown format so the comments will be in this format `<!-- asyncapi-example-tester:{test:'Operations Object',json_path:'$.operations'} -->` here `test` will be the name of the example being worked upon which can be treated as metadata to show in errors or logs that which part of the examples failed or is missing something, and the `json_path` is the jsonpath in which we have to replace the specific document part in the big base document itself. and the specified path should be checked, if it exists replace it there, otherwise create the field which is missing using the jsonpath

we will use the asyncapi cli to validate the updated document generated by the script 
Now we need that the new updated document which is created by the script is passed and validated by the cli tool and after validation is deleted, this should be done in the runtime itself and we don't want any extra document to be present after the whole process
